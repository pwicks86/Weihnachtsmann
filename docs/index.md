## Project Breakdown

The hat was built from the following pieces.

* Santa hat, bought from amazon.
* [Gemma-M0 microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501)
* [Skinny Neopixels](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2959)
* [2500 Mah LiPo Battery](https://www.adafruit.com/product/328)
* [Lilypad Button Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8776)
* 3 Pin JST connectors. I bought mine from amazon, but if I'd had more time I woould have bought them from Aliexpress. These aren't actually necessary, I could have soldered everything together directly, but I wanted to be able to dissasemble the hat later.

I also bought a [LiPo Charger from adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1304) as well.

Using the Gemma-M0 made this whole project doable in a short time-frame, since I could just solder everything together and then write a [little bit of python](https://github.com/pwicks86/Weihnachtsmann/blob/master/xmas_final.py) to run the various effects, rather than do it all in C.
